## Full Stack Frameworks with Django 

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/MelBiggs/fullstack-frameworks-project.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/MelBiggs/fullstack-frameworks-project)


A website selling skin products from all over the world

External userâ€™s goal:
Find, learn about and buy skin products or makeup for their particular skin issues

Site owner's goal:
Earn money on selling the products (the site owner is the seller)

Potential features to include:
Create an online store focused on selling various reliable skin products

Allow users to search for items based on various fields, e.g. skin type, skin problem, product type (moisturiser, toner, nightcream, daycream)

Allow users to see the price, image and other basic details about the product on the search page

When in the specific item, users would be able to learn about the product, the company, it's ingredients and the sites opinions on it.

For example, including what skin problems this tackled well or is there a famous person who has mentioned it.

Users have to be registered for this to purchase this. 

Allow registered users to write reviews about the products, only if they purchased them. - NOT COVERED IN THE COURSE, will need to research

Include pagination and/or other dynamic display actions using javascript.

Advanced potential feature (nice-to-have)

Expand the search functionality to allow users to sort results based on price, popularity and other parameters in both ascending and descending order.

Include pagination and/or other dynamic display actions using javascript.

Create a small graph detailing the most common skin problems or most popular creams etc
