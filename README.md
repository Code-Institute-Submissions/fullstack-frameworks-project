# Code Institute Milestone Project 
## Full Stack Frameworks with Django 

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/MelBiggs/fullstack-frameworks-project.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/MelBiggs/fullstack-frameworks-project)

Welcome to FaceValue. 

This a fictional e-commerce site selling skin products from all over the world, for all skin types and issues. 

Users can log in and find products according to type (e.g. moisturiser, eye cream) or category (e.g. face or body products). Customers can then review the products they buy. Users can read the blog to learn more about particular skin issues, and what we have found works the best. 

## Demo


## UX

This project is part of my studies in Full Stack Software Development with the Code Institute. This is my final project for this course, for the module **Full Stack Frameworks**.

The objective given for this project was *"Bring your own idea(s) to life, based on providing value to users to address a specific real or imagined need."* I wanted to incorporate elements of the other project ideas that were given by Code Institute. For example, one of the ideas was to build an auction place to sell historical artifacts, where users can find, learn about and acquire artifacts they are interested in. The site owner will earn money selling items.

I wanted to build a website that I myself would be interested in visiting. My idea was to create a website selling skin care products and to create a community to help people with their skin issues by finding out what worked for others. I wanted to create a place where users can go and see their particular skin issue discussed and they can find products relating to that issue. I wanted to include a blog where they can find more information on a variety of skin issues. 

I looked at the other project ideas given by the Code Institute and worked them into my idea: 

**Potential features to include:**
* Create an online store focused on selling various reliable skin products

* Allow users to search items based on various fields, e.g. product type (moisturiser, toner, nightcream, daycream)

* Allow users to filter items based on skin issue and currency

* Allow users to see the price, image and other basic details about the product on the search page

* When in the specific item, users would be able to learn about the product, the company, it's ingredients and the sites opinions on it, for example, what skin problems this tackled well*.

* Users have to be registered for this to purchase this. 

* Allow registered users to write reviews about the products, only if they purchased them.

* Include pagination and/or other dynamic display actions using javascript.


### User Stories

This site is intended for use by anyone who has an interest in skincare or has a particular issue they want to find products to relieve. They can find these products which can be filtered and purchase them online. The target audience is broad as skin issues don't chose an age or gender. Anyone who has an interest in purchasing a product or reading a blog to aid them in their skin care journey will find interest in this website.

### Design

I wanted to style the website with a clean, semi-clinical look. 

My colour scheme is:

| Colour Code   | Colour        | 
| ------------- |:-------------:|
