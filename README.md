## Here is what I still need to work on, as of 2nd of April: 

- Add content
- When content is added, make pagination 12 items per page. 
- Do Testing
- Favouriting Products - it applies to user as many times as they click the button. Need to make it so it only allows one click and one click to un-favourite. 
- Filtering by Skin Issue (products.html) - I need to apply the filters to work when in the Face and Body tab
- Reviews and Comments - more formatting and CSS
- Add a 'Clear Filter' button to filters in Products page
- Add Star Ratings for reviews (currently just an integer)

# Code Institute Milestone Project 
## Full Stack Frameworks with Django 

> Be good to your skin. You'll wear it every day for the rest of your life. 

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/MelBiggs/fullstack-frameworks-project.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/MelBiggs/fullstack-frameworks-project)

Welcome to FaceValue. 

This a fictional e-commerce site selling skin products from all over the world, for all skin types and issues. 

Users can log in and find products according to type (e.g. moisturiser, eye cream) or category (e.g. face or body products). Customers can then review the products they buy. Users can read the blog to learn more about particular skin issues, and what we have found works the best. 

## Demo


## UX

This project is part of my studies in Full Stack Software Development with the Code Institute. This is my final project for this course, for the module **Full Stack Frameworks**.

The objective given for this project was *"Bring your own idea(s) to life, based on providing value to users to address a specific real or imagined need."* I wanted to incorporate elements of the other project ideas that were given by Code Institute. For example, one of the ideas was to build an auction place to sell historical artifacts, where users can find, learn about and acquire artifacts they are interested in. The site owner will earn money selling items.

I wanted to build a website that I myself would be interested in visiting. My idea was to create a website selling skin care products and to create a community to help people with their skin issues by finding out what worked for others. I wanted to create a place where users can go and see their particular skin issue discussed and they can find products relating to that issue. I wanted to include a blog where they can find more information on a variety of skin issues. 

I looked at the other project ideas given by the Code Institute and worked them into my idea: 

**Potential features to include:**
* Create an online store focused on selling various reliable skin products

* Allow users to search items based on various fields, e.g. product type (moisturiser, toner, nightcream, daycream)

* Allow users to filter items based on skin issue and currency

* Allow users to see the price, image and other basic details about the product on the search page

* When in the specific item, users would be able to learn about the product, the company, it's ingredients and the sites opinions on it, for example, what skin problems this tackled well*.

* Users have to be registered for this to purchase this. 

* Allow registered users to write reviews about the products, only if they purchased them.

* Include pagination and/or other dynamic display actions.


### User Stories

This site is intended for use by anyone who has an interest in skincare or has a particular issue they want to find products to relieve. They can find these products which can be filtered and purchase them online. The target audience is broad as skin issues don't chose an age or gender. Anyone who has an interest in purchasing a product or reading a blog to aid them in their skin care journey will find interest in this website. 

_"As a user I would like to"_**

* view all products and blog posts without logging in 
* view the site from any device (mobile, tablet, desktop)
* leave a review for products I liked
* be able to register and log in/out
* be able to change my password 
* filter products based on a particular skin issue
* find products for my face or my body 
* search through all products and blogposts 
* find products of a particular type e.g. moisturisers
* comment on blog posts 
* upvote products I have enjoyed 
* see how many views a blogpost has 
* to be able to buy products I found worked
* do all the above on an easily navigated and attractive website 
* have a shopping cart I can easily add and remove items from
* filter blog posts by age


### Design

I wanted to style the website with a clean, semi-clinical look. 

#### Colour Scheme

| Colour Code   | Description   | 
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
| #6c757d       | deep blueish grey|
| #fff7ff       | pale pink     | 


#### Typography

I used [Poppins](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins) as my navigation bar font and [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto) as the font for the project body.  

#### Frameworks

* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - 
Having used Materialize for my last project, I was happy to make a return to Bootstrap as I find it to be a great framework and easy to use.

* [JQuery](https://jquery.com/) - 
The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.

* [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) - 
Django is a free and open-source web framework that I've used to render the back-end Python with the front-end Bootstrap.

#### Icons

I used [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery) for the icons in my project

### Wireframes

For my wireframes I used paper and pencil initially. 
[Here is a link to my wireframe]( )

## Features

### Features left to implement

I would like to add the following features in time: 
* Calculating the shipping and handling fees into the total value
* Expand the currency used to include GBP and USD 

## Technologies Used

* [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/) -  Gitpod is the code editor I used
* [Github](https://github.com/) - Github was used as remote storage
* [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/) - Font Awesome is a great library of icons. I used this library for any icons.
* [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) - There is a great selection of fonts in the Google Fonts library, some of which I used in my project.

### Frontend Technologies

* [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML) - HTML was used to control the layout and the structure of the project.
* [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets) - Cascading Style Sheets are used to describe the appearance of a website and I used it to make my website look appealing to the user.
* [JQuery](https://jquery.com/) - jQuery is the primary JavaScript functionality.
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - This is the front-end framework for layout and design.
* [Stripe](https://stripe.com/ie) - Stripe allows the user to make secure payments.
* [Amazon AWS](https://signin.aws.amazon.com/signin?redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fconsole.aws.amazon.com%2Fconsole%2Fhome%3Fstate%3DhashArgs%2523%26isauthcode%3Dtrue&client_id=arn%3Aaws%3Aiam%3A%3A015428540659%3Auser%2Fhomepage&forceMobileApp=0#) - I stored my staticfiles and media in AWS 

### Backend Technologies

* [Python]( https://www.python.org/) - This is the back-end programming language.
* [Heroku]( https://heroku.com/) - The app is hosted on Heroku.
* [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) - Django is a Python web framework I used.
* [Django](https://www.postgresql.org/) - Through Heroku, this is a relational SQL database plugin.


### Backend Technologies
[Gifox](https://gifox.io/) - I used Gifox to record the website demo for my README file. I recorded it off the website [Am I Responsive](http://ami.responsivedesign.is/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmelbiggs.github.io%2Fifd-milestoneproject%2F#)


## Testing

### Validators

#### HTML

[W3C Markup Validation Service]( https://validator.w3.org/)

The HTML for *accounts*, *blog*, *cart*, *checkout*, *home*, *products* and *base.html* all came back fine, although it did not like that I didn't have a DOCTYPE for each HTML page. 

#### CSS

[W3C CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)

#### JavaScript

[JSHint]( https://jshint.com/)

#### Python

[PEP8]( http://pep8online.com/)

A few files contained lines which were too long so once these were adjusted, they passed the validator without issue. 

* *Accounts App* - `backends.py`, `forms.py`, `url_reset.py`, `urls.py` and `views.py` came back with 'All right'. 

* *Blog App* - `forms.py`, `models.py`, `urls.py` and `views.py` came back with 'All right'. 

* *Cart App* - `contexts.py`, `models.py`, `urls.py` and `views.py` came back with 'All right'. 

* *Checkout App* - `forms.py`, `models.py`, `urls.py` and `views.py` came back with 'All right'. 

* *Home App* - `views.py` came back with 'All right'.

* *Products App* -  `admin.py`, `forms.py`, `models.py`, `urls.py` and `views.py` came back with 'All right'. 

* *Search Apps* - `urls.py` and `views.py` came back with 'All right'. 

I also checked `custom_storages.py` and that also came back with an 'All right'.

### Code

* When I was working out how to get tag filtering working (i.e. filtering by skin issue), these sources really helped me:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4915920/how-to-delete-an-item-in-a-list-if-it-exists - This helped me remove 'page' from filter_keys
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24763045/capture-all-url-parameters-in-django-views-py - This helped me in getting all the GET parameters
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16819222/how-to-return-dictionary-keys-as-a-list-in-python - This taught me how to get keys using `[*]`

* These code snippets helped me find the URL query parameters with JavaScript so that the pagination worked with filters and to make the checkbox stay selected :
https://medium.com/@junaidahmed/get-url-query-params-with-jquery-js-c12f5fed0f71
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10930048/get-checkbox-with-specific-value
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4735342/jquery-to-loop-through-elements-with-the-same-class


* These websites helped me flesh out my password reset view and to add a subject line:
https://github.com/django/django/blob/master/django/contrib/auth/templates/registration/password_reset_subject.txt 
https://simpleisbetterthancomplex.com/tutorial/2016/09/19/how-to-create-password-reset-view.html 

* This question on Stack Overflow helped me to target a URL for my All, Face and Body Products tab:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34649131/javascript-how-to-check-if-url-contains-a-word/34649157

I also received tips on snippets of my code through [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/), [CodePen]( https://codepen.io/) and [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/).
